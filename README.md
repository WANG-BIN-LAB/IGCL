# IGCL
# Abstract
Accurate individual identification based on functional connectivity (FC) serves as the foundation for advancing brain network analysis from population-level infer- ences to individual-level studies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have potential advantages over existing individual identification methods in preserving topological fidelity and supporting scalability. However, due to the insufficient supervision within each individual, GNNs struggle to directly capture individual-specific pat- terns, which hinders their application in this domain. Motivated by this constraint, we find that graph contrastive learning (GCL) methods hold strong promise in 8 addressing the scarcity of individual-level supervision issue by leveraging self- supervised signals derived from intra- and inter-individual contrasts. To design GCL methods for individual identification, we need to tackle two fundamental challenges. On the one hand, most GCL encoders rely on single-scale graph rep- resentations, which fail to capture individual-specific patterns distributed across different topological levels, severely hindering comprehensive individual represen- tation. On the other hand, standard contrastive losses struggle with extreme sample imbalance and low intra-individual similarity, leading to ineffective feature discrim- ination. In our work, we propose an Individualized Graph Contrastive Learning (IGCL) framework. Briefly, we design a multi-scale topology enhanced graph attention network (MSTE-GAT) to capture individual-specific patterns spanning from local to global structures. Moreover, a customized contrastive loss named hard negative mined and corrective NT-Xent (HCNT-Xent) is formulated, which integrates hard negative mining to focus on challenging negatives and introduces a corrective term to stabilize gradients and enforce margin-like separation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IGCL framework outperforms all state-of-the-art methods. To evaluate the cross-task transferability of IGCL, we further conducted a gender classification task, where our model likewise achieved strong performance.
